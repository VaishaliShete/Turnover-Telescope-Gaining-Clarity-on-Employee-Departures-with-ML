# **Employee Turnover Telescope**
![Quotation-Steve-Jobs-Great-things-in-business-are-never-done-by-one-person-105-74-15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1098f3cd-6999-46e0-8d7d-54e2f9308cef)


## Business Problem
***
One of the most common problems at work is turnover.

Replacing a worker earning about $50,000 cost the company about $10,000 or 20% of that workerâ€™s yearly income according to the Center of American Progress. Replacing a high-level employee can cost multiple of that.

- Cost of off-boarding
- Cost of hiring (advertising, interviewing, hiring)
- Cost of onboarding a new person (training, management time)
- Lost productivity (a new person may take 1-2 years to reach the productivity of an existing person)*

## Objective
***
The implementation of this model will allow management to create better decision-making actions.
1. To understand what factors contributed most to employee turnover
2. To create a model that predicts the likelihood if a certain employee will leave the company or not.
3. To create or improve different retention strategies on targeted employees

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of employee records, including attributes such as employee satisfaction, performance evaluations, tenure, and turnover status. The dataset will be preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for analysis and modeling.

## Approach

1. Obtaining the data is the first approach in solving the problem.
2. Scrubbing or cleaning the data. Imputing missing data and converting data to its right format. 
3. Exploring the data. Understanding our variables and find patterns in our dataset.
4. Modeling the data will give us our predictive power on whether an employee will leave.
5. Interpreting the data. What conclusions can we make? What happened?

## Solution

**Retention Plan**
- The goal is to create a retention plan!
- We can help identify who is in need of more support to prevent potential turnover. 
- This model will predict and calculate the likelihood of each employee sticking around in the company

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
